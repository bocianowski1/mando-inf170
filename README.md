# Supply Chain Model & Cost Minimization

### About the Assignment

This is the mandatory assignment in the optimization course INF170. There were 3 tasks in which we had to design a mathematical model, including objective function and constraints.

I used Gurobi to solve the supply chain model and Pandas to explore and handle the data we were given.

A **license** is needed to use Gurobi on this big of a model. I used [the academic license]('https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/').
